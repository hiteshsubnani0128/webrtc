Since 6 years of its founding, it has impacted careers of 10,000+ working professionals Great Learning’s online programs are flipped classroom instructor led programs. In flip classroom format, learners are expected to go through video lectures on a weekly basis and then participate in live online instructor led sessions in a micro group containing up to 10 learners. The agenda of instruction led session is to do a quick debrief of video lectures for the week and discuss practical applications of the concepts covered in the video lecture of the week The problem statement is to create a mechanism to monitor and measure the attention span of the learners in the instructor led online sessions. Following are a few ideas on the measures that can be used to quantify the level of attention span:
• out of the designated session-time, what proportion of session was one-way dialogue vs two-way dialogue • number of distinct learners who participated in the session
• presence of background noise, chatters in the session, etc.. Expected Outcomes
• Real time dashboard that quantifies the participation for each participant
• Real time triggers in case of sub-optimal participation
• Suggestions (along with implementation) of other ideas to quantify level / quality of interactions Great Learning will be sharing sample recording of the online mentored sessions
